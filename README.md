    main.py has google sign in/sign in with google implemented.To use it u have to get your credentials from the google deevelopers console online.Although implementing it requires work,we did you all the work,just  get the keys from a non testing account/assuming you are building a commercial project and fill in all the required
    details.Mpesa is already integrated within together with a working landing page for your customization.

    mpesa.py all the logic for the mpesa stk push code.it is already integrated with all the other components,this file exists to test the mpesa stk push to see if it works,whoch it does(at least on my machine "the oldest excuse")
